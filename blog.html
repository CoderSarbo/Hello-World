			<h1>ICC CRICKET World Cup</h1>
			<p>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket.
             The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary 
             qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is
             considered the "flagship event of the international cricket calendar" by the ICC.

             The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However,
             a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international 
             teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The 
             first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial 
             rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.
             The World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic
             qualification. 
             The remaining teams are determined via the World Cricket League and the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in 
             the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015; the next edition in 2019 will have only ten teams.
             Australia has won the tournament five times, with the West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once each) also having won the
			 tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament</p>

			<h1>FIFA FOOTBALL WORLD CUP</h1>
			<p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.

                    The current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals. After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.
                    
                    The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain with one title each.
                    
                    The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.
                    
                    17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three finals.</p>

			<p>Sport has historically played an important role in all societies, be it in the form of competitive sport, physical activity or play.
				The right of access to, and participation in, sport and play has long been recognised in a number of international conventions. In 1978,
